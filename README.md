# ReportCardMonitor
Python Selenium script to login, crawl, scrape and to store data

Created a script to keep track of my Grades and store them in a txt file
alongside with the date of scraping

# Logging in
I made this script for my university's moodle page, I mostly used xpaths and ids 
to click on buttons, the username and password arent stored on the script. It has to be
inputted as you are logging in

# Scraping and Storing
The grades on my overview report get copied, printed and stored into a txt file

# Organization and Data Collection
This way I can collect data regarding my academic performance during this year
by automating this script. By making it run between intervals
